# learns
A place for me to learn coding and GitHub 

Hey cats! I'm here to learn how to code.
I've been a tech writer for 15 years. Before that I developed and maintained an office automation system for a law office using MS Access (I was also their legal assistant.)
I serve nine cats at my house. 

I was born in Mesquite TX, spent my childhood moving around Kentucky, and my teens in Birmingham AL. I moved to WA a month shy of my 21st birthday and have remained here except for a month in San Diego.

I'm not done becoming me yet, and learning to code is another branch on my life repository.
