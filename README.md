## A place for me to learn coding and GitHub 

Hello! I'm here to learn how to code. Or not code, depending on the platform. (Hi, Power Apps!)

I've been a tech writer for 15 years. Before that I did metal-to-monitor database management (Dell rackmounted servers->SuSE Linux->Oracle->MS Access+Oracle Portal) for the Vice Provost of Planning and Budgeting at UW. Before that I developed and maintained an office automation system for a law office using MS Access (I was also their legal assistant.)

I serve nine cats at [my house](https://gismaps.kingcounty.gov/parcelviewer2/?xmin=-13606031.99054631&ymin=6020933.521191586&xmax=-13605468.864626912&ymax=6021170.595412159). 

I was born in Mesquite TX, spent my childhood moving around Kentucky, and my teens in Birmingham AL. I moved to WA a month shy of my 21st birthday and have remained here except for a month in San Diego.

I'm not done becoming me yet, and learning to code is another branch on my life repository. Is there a schmaltz tag in Markdown?
